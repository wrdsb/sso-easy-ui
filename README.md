# SSO Easy UI
This repo tracks UI code and assets, as they appear in a user's browser, for SSO Easy. This includes code (HTML) generated by the application, as well as custom code written to brand the software.

This allows us to track UI changes within the application, from verson to version of the vendor-supplied software, and then make corresponding changes to UI customizations and automated tests. 

# Updating
1. Open google.wrdsb.ca in Firefox. This will redirect to https://sso.wrdsb.ca/LoginFormIdentityProvider/Login.aspx
2. Right click => Save Page As...
3. Change filename to Single_Sign_On.html
4. Keep default option of "Web Page, complete".
5. Save.
6. Take a screenshot and save as screenshot.png
7. Copy saved files over top of files in repo. Commit.

# Tracking Changes
Simply view the diff for any two commits to see what user-facing changes have been made in the application. The file screenshot.png will be overwritten with each commit (because it cannot be diff'ed). Browse previous versions to see changes visually as they appear in the user's browser.
