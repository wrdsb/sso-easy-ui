# SSO Easy UI
This repo tracks UI code and assets, as they appear in a user's browser, for SSO Easy. This includes code (HTML) generated by the application, as well as custom code written to brand the software.

This allows us to track UI changes within the application, from verson to version of the vendor-supplied software, and then make corresponding changes to UI customizations and automated tests.
